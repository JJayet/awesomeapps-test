# Awestagram

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd awesomeapps-test
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
API_KEY=your_api_key BASE_PATH=the_base_url_of_the_api npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

## Deploying to the web

### With [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

Install `vercel` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash

vercel deploy --name my-project
```

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:
